# threefold-way-dimension-reduction-synchronization
Code for the paper "[Threefold way to the dimension reduction of dynamics on networks: An application to synchronization](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.043215)". The code is not cleaned up. One should find all the necessary information (equations and important packages) to implement the method of the project in the paper:

From the README.txt in the file simulations:

Figures 6 and 7 of the paper are obtained with the Python script "simulations/synchro_transition_kuramoto_reduction_multiple_targets.py".

Figure 8 of the paper is obtained with the Python script "simulations/get_synchro_transitions_multiple_realizations.py".

Figure 13 of the paper is obtained from the Python script "simulations/synchro_transition_kuramoto_sakaguchi_one_star.py".

"simulations/synchro_transition_kuramoto_reduction_combination_WKA.py" is to answer to the question 1 of the reviewer.

"simulations/synchro_transition_kuramoto_reduction_different_n.py" is to answer to the
question 2 of the reviewer. See also "get_M_for_each_n.py" in graphs/two_triangles
