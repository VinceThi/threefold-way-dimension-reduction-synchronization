The file threefold-way-dimension-reduction-synchronization contains a subset of the documents in network-synch.

threefold-way-dimension-reduction-synchronization is meant to be the clean version of network-synch.

So, threefold-way-dimension-reduction-synchronization is on GitHub, but not network-synch anymore.

network-synch still contains important data (and sometimes, heavy data) and there might be some interesting scripts
remaining too.
